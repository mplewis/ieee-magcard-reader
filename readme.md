IEEE Magcard Reader
===================

What does it do?
================

It reads your U card and parses out the ID number, first, and last name, then records them to a dict and saves the time it was stored.

Also, it speaks your name out loud. Because that's awesome.

What do I need?
===============

You need the following programs installed:

 * `espeak` for text-to-speech

Can I turn off TTS?
===================

No, because I am too lazy to add a configuration file.

Can I add some features?
========================

Pull request whatever you want. I don't mind.
